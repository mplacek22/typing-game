Bangkok's traffic can be a nightmare.
Sure, you can easily take a taxi – if you want to spend hours stuck in traffic jams – but there are two much better ways to get around the city.
To explore the temples and historical sites, catch an express boat river taxi or a longtail boat along the Chao Phraya river and the canals.
For the modern part of the city, the Skytrain is a fast, cheap way to travel from the river to the shopping malls and nightlife of Sukhumvit, and the famous Chatuchak street market.
